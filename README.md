This repository contains several mini-projects written in Python. Each project demonstrates the use of core Python concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and object-oriented programming principles.

## Projects

The following projects are included in this repository:

1.  [To-Do List](https://github.com/Devansh80/Simple-Python-Projects/tree/master/Todo-List)
2.  [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Devansh80/Simple-Python-Projects/tree/master/Tic-tac-toe)
3.  [Address Book](https://github.com/Devansh80/Simple-Python-Projects/tree/master/Address-Book)
4.  [Password Manager](https://github.com/Devansh80/Simple-Python-Projects/tree/master/Password-Manager)
5.  [Hangman](https://github.com/Devansh80/Simple-Python-Projects/tree/master/Hangman)
6.  [ATM](https://github.com/Devansh80/Simple-Python-Projects/tree/master/ATM-Machine)

## To-Do List

The To-Do List project is a simple command-line application that allows the user to add tasks to a list and mark them as completed. The project demonstrates the use of basic data structures and control structures in Python.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

The Tic-Tac-Toe project is a command-line implementation of the classic game. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles in Python, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Address Book

The Address Book project is a simple command-line application that allows the user to add, delete, and view contacts. The project demonstrates the use of file I/O and exception handling in Python.

## Password Manager

The Password Manager project is a command-line application that allows the user to store and retrieve passwords for various accounts. The project demonstrates the use of encryption and decryption techniques in Python.

## Hangman

The Hangman project is a command-line implementation of the classic game. The project demonstrates the use of basic data structures and control structures in Python.

## ATM

The ATM project is a command-line simulation of an automated teller machine. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles in Python, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also includes additional features such as pin authentication, transaction history, and cash withdrawal limits.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

These projects are designed to be simple yet effective demonstrations of various Python concepts. They can be used as learning tools or as starting points for more complex projects. Feel free to clone this repository and modify the code to suit your needs. 

ðŸŒŸ Happy coding!
